                        After thorough reflections, I made a decision to join an immersive coding bootcamp at Coding Dojo.
                        During 15 weeks of my bootcamp period, I intensively coded, searched, read, and coded more. It was an incredible learning experience for me, and I would love to join or organize an immersive coding training opportinuty in the future. This is what my bootcamp experience looks like:

                    <p className="white-text about-left">
                    Here is my progress matrix during bootcamp:
                    # of hours coded:	Too many
                    # of lines committed on Github:	Lost Count
                    Average # of coffees consumed:	Over 5  Per Day
                    # of Black Belt obtained: In All Domains !
                    
                    *Black Belt is the highest level of achievement in knowledge and skills at Coding Dojo
